<h1>Build and Survive Script - Kill All Bots</h1>

A new script in the Roblox game *Build and Survive* simplifies gameplay with a single powerful feature: eliminating all hostile bots instantly via a "nuke the scaries" button, allowing players to survive effortlessly. Released in 2019, the game has garnered over 130 million visits and 750,000 favorites, challenging users to construct defensive bases against waves of monsters through creative building strategies. However, this script bypasses the core mechanic entirelyâ€”instead of designing intricate structures to withstand attacks, players can now obliterate threats with a single click. While the original mode emphasizes tactical construction and survival, the tool offers a shortcut, transforming the experience into a straightforward victory over enemies without the need for elaborate planning or building.
